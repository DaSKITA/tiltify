# TILTify

## Description


This is a repository to test out Natural Language Processing on Labeled Privacy Policies.
The annotations of the policies are performed in the [TILT Schema](https://github.com/Transparency-Information-Language/schema)
The goal is to infer TILT Labels for a given privacy policy and thus perform automated annotations for these policies.
