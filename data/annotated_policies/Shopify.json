{"document": {"document_name": "Shopify", "text": "Introduction\r\n\r\nIn our mission to make commerce better for everyone at Shopify, we collect and use information about you, our\r\n\r\nmerchants using Shopify to power your business\r\ncustomers who shop at a Shopify-powered business\r\npartners who develop apps for merchants to use, build stores on behalf of merchants, refer potential entrepreneurs to Shopify, or otherwise help merchants operate or improve their Shopify-powered business\r\nusers of Shopify apps and services like Shop or Shop Pay\r\nvisitors to Shopify\u2019s websites, or anyone contacting Shopify support\r\nThis Privacy Policy will help you better understand how we collect, use, and share your personal information. If we change our privacy practices, we may update this privacy policy. If any changes are significant, we will let you know (for example, through the Shopify admin or by email).\r\n\r\nOur values\r\n\r\nTrust is the foundation of the Shopify platform and includes trusting us to do the right thing with your information. Three main values guide us as we develop our products and services. These values should help you better understand how we think about your information and privacy.\r\n\r\nYour information belongs to you\r\n\r\nWe carefully analyze what types of information we need to provide our services, and we try to limit the information we collect to only what we really need. Where possible, we delete or anonymize this information when we no longer need it. When building and improving our products, our engineers work closely with our privacy and security teams to build with privacy in mind. In all of this work our guiding principle is that your information belongs to you, and we aim to only use your information to your benefit.\r\n\r\nWe protect your information from others\r\n\r\nIf a third party requests your personal information, we will refuse to share it unless you give us permission or we are legally required. When we are legally required to share your personal information, we will tell you in advance, unless we are legally forbidden.\r\n\r\nWe help merchants and partners meet their privacy obligations\r\n\r\nMany of the merchants and partners using Shopify do not have the benefit of a dedicated privacy team, and it is important to us to help them meet their privacy obligations. To do this, we try to build our products and services so they can easily be used in a privacy-friendly way. We also provide detailed FAQs, documentation and whitepapers covering the most important privacy topics, and respond to privacy-related questions we receive.\r\n\r\nWhy we process your information\r\n\r\nWe generally process your information when we need to do so to fulfill a contractual obligation (for example, to process your subscription payments to use the Shopify platform), or where we or someone we work with needs to use your personal information for a reason related to their business (for example, to provide you with a service). European law calls these reasons \u201clegitimate interests.\u201d These \u201clegitimate interests\u201d include:\r\n\r\npreventing risk and fraud\r\nanswering questions or providing other types of support\r\nhelping merchants find and use apps through our app store\r\nproviding and improving our products and services\r\nproviding reporting and analytics\r\ntesting out features or additional services\r\nassisting with marketing, advertising, or other communications\r\nWe only process personal information for these \u201clegitimate interests\u201d after considering the potential risks to your privacy\u2014for example, by providing clear transparency into our privacy practices, offering you control over your personal information where appropriate, limiting the information we keep, limiting what we do with your information, who we send your information to, how long we keep your information, or the technical measures we use to protect your information.\r\n\r\nOne of the ways in which we are able to help merchants using Shopify is by using techniques like \u201cmachine learning\u201d (European law refers to this as \u201cautomated decision-making\u201d) to help us improve our services. When we use machine learning, we either: (1) still have a human being involved in the process (and so are not fully automated); or (2) use machine learning in ways that don\u2019t have significant privacy implications (for example, reordering how apps might appear when you visit the app store).\r\n\r\nYour rights over your information\r\n\r\nWe believe you should be able to access and control your personal information no matter where you live. Depending on how you use Shopify, you may have the right to request access to, correct, amend, delete, port to another service provider, restrict, or object to certain uses of your personal information (for example, direct marketing). We will not charge you more or provide you with a different level of service if you exercise any of these rights.\r\n\r\nIf you buy something from a Shopify-powered store and wish to exercise these rights over information about your purchase, you need to directly contact the merchant you interacted with. We are only a processor on their behalf, and cannot decide how to process their information. We will of course help our merchants to fulfill these requests by giving them the tools to do so and by answering their questions.\r\n\r\nIf you are a merchant, partner, Shop user, Shopify employee, or other individual that Shopify has a direct relationship with, please submit your data subject request through our online portal. Please note that if you send us a request relating to your personal information, we have to make sure that it is you before we can respond. In order to do so, we may use a third party to collect and verify identification documents.\r\n\r\nIf you are not happy with our response to a request, you can contact us to resolve the issue. You also have the right to contact your local data protection or privacy authority at any time.\r\n\r\nFinally, because there is no common understanding about what a \u201cDo Not Track\u201d signal is supposed to mean, we don\u2019t respond to those signals in any particular way.\r\n\r\nWhere we send your information\r\n\r\nWe are a Canadian company, but we work with and process data about individuals across the world. To operate our business, we may send your personal information outside of your state, province, or country, including to the United States. This data may be subject to the laws of the countries where we send it. When we send your information across borders, we take steps to protect your information, and we try to only send your information to countries that have strong data protection laws.\r\n\r\nTransfers outside of Europe and Switzerland\r\n\r\nIf you are in Europe or Switzerland, your personal information is controlled by our Irish affiliate, Shopify International Ltd. Your information is then sent to other Shopify locations and to service providers who may be located in other regions, including Canada (where we are based) and the United States. When we send your personal information outside of Europe, we do so in accordance with European law.\r\n\r\nIf you are in Europe or Switzerland, when we send your personal information to Canada it is protected under Canadian law, which the European Commission has found will adequately protect your information. If we then send this personal information outside of Canada (for example, when we send this information to our Subprocessors), this information is protected by contractual commitments that are comparable to those provided in Standard Contractual Clauses.\r\n\r\nFinally, while we do what we can to protect your information, we may at times be legally required to disclose your personal information (for example, if we receive a valid court order). For information about how we respond to such orders, please review our Guidelines for Legal Requests.\r\n\r\nHow we protect your information\r\n\r\nOur teams work tirelessly to protect your information, and to ensure the security and integrity of our platform. We also have independent auditors assess the security of our data storage and systems that process financial information. However, we all know that no method of transmission over the Internet, and method of electronic storage, can be 100% secure. This means we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your personal information. You can find more information about our security measures at https://www.shopify.com/security.\r\n\r\nHow we use \u201ccookies\u201d and other tracking technologies\r\n\r\nWe use cookies and similar tracking technologies on our website and when providing our services. For more information about how we use these technologies, including a list of other companies that place cookies on our sites, a list of cookies that we place when we power a merchant\u2019s store, and an explanation of how you can opt out of certain types of cookies, please see our Cookie Policy.\r\n\r\nHow you can reach us\r\n\r\nIf you would like to ask about, make a request relating to, or complain about how we process your personal information, please contact Shopify Support, or mail us at one of the addresses below. If you would like to submit a legally binding request to demand someone else\u2019s personal information (for example, if you have a subpoena or court order), please review our Guidelines for Legal Requests.\r\n\r\nShopify Inc.\r\nATTN: Chief Privacy Officer \r\n151 O\u2019Connor Street \r\nGround floor, \r\nOttawa, ON K2P 2L8 \r\nCanada\r\n\r\nIf you are located in Europe, the Middle East, South America, or Africa:\r\n\r\nShopify International Ltd.\r\nAttn: Data Protection Officer \r\nc/o Intertrust Ireland \r\n2nd Floor 1-2 Victoria Buildings \r\nHaddington Road \r\nDublin 4, D04 XN32 \r\nIreland\r\n\r\nIf you are located in Asia, Australia, or New Zealand:\r\n\r\nShopify Commerce Singapore PTE.
