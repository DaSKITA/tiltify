This includes, for example, your real name, address, telephone number and date of birth. Information that is not directly linked to your true identity \u2013 such as favorite websites or a site\u2019s number of users \u2013 does not constitute personal data.\r\n\r\nGoogle reCAPTCHA\r\n\r\nWe use the reCAPTCHA service from Google Inc. (1600 Amphitheatre Parkway Mountain View, CA 94043, USA) to protect our website against spam and misuse. reCAPTCHA prevents automated software (termed \u201cbots\u201d) from engaging in abusive activities on the website, i.e. it helps check whether the inputs are actually made by a human being. In order to determine this, the following data is transferred to Google:\r\n\r\nReferrer (the address of the site on which the CAPTCHA is used)\r\nThe user\u2019s IP address\r\nThe user\u2019s Google account (the account is recognized and assigned if the user is logged on to Google)\r\nThe user\u2019s input behavior (such as answering of the reCAPTCHA question, the speed at which inputs are made in the form fields, the sequence in which the user selected the input fields) is used to improve pattern recognition in Google. The browser, its size and resolution, browser plug-ins, date, and language setting\r\nDisplay instructions (CSS) and scripts (JavaScript) for the website\r\nMouse and touch events on the page\r\nGoogle also reads the cookies from other Google services, such as Gmail, Search and Analytics. All the specified data is sent to Google in encrypted form. Google\u2019s subsequent analysis determines the form in which the CAPTCHA is shown on the page: as a checkbox or a box in which text is entered. Personal data from the input fields of the form in question is not read or stored.\r\n\r\nThe data is processed on the basis of Article 6(1) letter (f) GDPR. Deutsche Post AG has a legitimate interest in protecting the websites of deutschepost.de against abusive automated attempts to access them and spam.\r\n\r\nYou can find more information on Google\u2019s Privacy Policy at www.google.com/policies/privacy/.\r\n\r\nPurpose of data processing\r\n\r\nWe process your data, for example,\r\n\r\nto satisfy the terms of the contract we signed with you or with a sender;\r\nto ensure that your visit to our websites/apps is as pleasant as possible;\r\nto send you a newsletter if you are a subscriber;\r\nto send or show you tailored advertising, to the extent permissible;\r\nto conduct a creditworthiness check as necessary;\r\nto satisfy legal requirements (e.g. the German Code of Criminal Procedure (StPO) or German Foreign Trade and Payments Act (AWG));\r\nin connection with our security requirements (e.g. to uncover criminal activity);\r\nto produce statistics;\r\nto secure payment;\r\nand for purposes of quality assurance, process optimization and reliable planning.\r\nYou will find further details on, for example, the type of data, the purpose of data processing, and the legal basis in the sections on the respective products.\r\n\r\nPlease use our contact form if you wish to exercise any of your rights.\r\n\r\nAs a data subject, you have the right:\r\n\r\na) to obtain information on and access to the data stored about you,\r\n\r\nb) to demand that incorrect data we store concerning you be rectified,\r\n\r\nc) to have your personal data erased or, if statutory retention periods apply, restrict the processing of data no longer required for the specified purpose,\r\n\r\nd) to access the personal data you provided in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format,\r\n\r\ne) to raise an objection if your data is being processed on the grounds of a legitimate interest / to the use of your data for advertising purposes / to your being subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling,\r\n\r\nf) to file a complaint with the competent supervisory authority if you suspect that your data has not been processed in compliance with data protection legislation.\r\n\r\nIf you do not provide the data indicated as being necessary, a contract cannot be established.\r\n\r\nShould you wish to exercise any of your rights, please contact us\r\n\r\nby contact form: www.deutschepost.de/datenschutz/kontakt.\r\n\r\nIf you exercise your right to object \u2013 especially to the use of your data for advertising purposes \u2013 please contact the address given in the relevant \u201cProducts and Services\u201d section.\r\n\r\nIf you have consented to your personal data being used for a certain type of processing, you may withdraw such consent at any time with future effect by notifying us at the address we specified when you gave your consent.

The need therefor follows either from statutory retention periods, for example, as set forth in Section 257 of the German Commercial Code (HGB) or Section 147 of the German Fiscal Code (AO). In the absence of statutory retention periods, the data is stored for the purpose of fulfilling and settling the given contract and for evidencing proper fulfillment until the expiration of applicable liability periods; it is erased thereafter.\r\n\r\nGroup Data Privacy Policy\r\n\r\nThe DPDHL Data Privacy Policy defines Group-wide standards for data processing, with a specific focus on so-called third-country transfers, meaning the transmission of personal data to countries outside the EU which do not offer an adequate level of data protection.

Other personal data, such as your name, address, telephone number or e-mail address, is not collected unless you provide this data voluntarily, for example as part of a registration procedure, survey, competition, performance of a contract or request for information.\r\n\r\nUse and forwarding of personal data\r\n\r\nWe use the personal data provided by you exclusively for the purpose of technical administration of our websites and to fulfill your wishes and requirements, i.e. generally to perform the contract concluded with you or to respond to your inquiry.\r\n \r\nWe only use such data for product-related surveys and marketing purposes if you have given us your prior consent and if you have not filed an objection, insofar as this is permitted by law.\r\n \r\nYour personal data is not disclosed, sold or otherwise transferred to third parties, unless that is necessary for handling the contract or you have given your explicit consent.

You agree that an Adform cookie may be saved to your device and that this cookie identifier (\u201ccookie ID\u201d) may be forwarded to Deutsche Post AG for use within the framework of Concentric Services.

Valid for one year.\r\n\r\nSecurity\r\n\r\nDeutsche Post takes all necessary technical and organizational security measures to protect your personal data from being lost or misused. For instance, your data is saved in a secure operating environment which is not accessible to the public. In certain cases, your personal data is encrypted by Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology during transmission. This means that an approved encryption procedure is used for communication between your computer and the Deutsche Post servers if your browser supports SSL.\r\n\r\nShould you wish to contact Deutsche Post by e-mail, we would like to point out that the confidentiality of the information sent cannot be guaranteed. The contents of e-mail messages can be read by third parties. We therefore advise you to send us confidential information solely by post.\r\n\r\nHow to manage cookies\r\n\r\nIt is also possible to use our products and services without cookies. You can normally deactivate the saving of cookies in your browser or limit them to certain websites. The browser can be set to notify you when a cookie is sent. You can also delete cookies from your hard drive at any time (\u201ccookies\u201d folder). However, in this case you will have to expect restricted page presentation and user guidance.\r\n\r\nFor detailed information on cookies, such as how to see which cookies have been set and how to manage and delete them, visit:\r\n\r\nAll About Cookies\r\n\r\nFor further EU-specific recommendations on cookies and the various opt-out options, please visit the following website:           \r\n\r\nYour Online Choices\r\n\r\nIf you wish to switch off general web tracking by Adobe SiteCatalyst (web-tracking cookies), you can find further information on the following website:\r\n\r\nLink for individual cookies\r\n\r\nAdobe Sitecatalist Tracking Opting OUT\r\n\r\nIf you wish to switch off some or all of the advertising cookies set on your computer, you can find further information on the following website:    \r\n\r\nNetwork Advertising Initative (NAI)\r\n\r\nReference to address matching technology\r\n\r\nUse of Deutsche Post AG\u2019s address matching technology \u2013 your right to object\r\n\r\nOur website uses Deutsche Post AG\u2019s address matching technology to determine statistical parameters and to form target groups for advertising purposes (offline and online). For this measurement, your stored delivery or billing address is assigned by a commissioned service provider to an anonymous microcell of Deutsche Post Direkt GmbH (\u00d8 6.6 households), and this code is stored in encrypted form with another service provider (address matching).\r\n\r\nThe legal basis for this use of the address, in shared responsibility between us and Deutsche Post AG, is Article 6 (1) sentence 1 letter (f) GDPR. The address is deleted at the service provider\u2019s end immediately after matching. It is therefore the website operator who is responsible for this initial processing step \u2013 the use of the stored address for the purpose of matching it against the microcell database. The same applies to the pixelization of the website described below and the forwarding of a user\u2019s request to Deutsche Post AG for subsequent labeling using a cookie.\r\n\r\nIf you have given your consent, after you have accessed our website, an inquiry from the device used by you is initiated on a server operated by a service provider commissioned by Deutsche Post AG, which stores two cookies on the PC or other device used by you. This consent also includes the authorization to subsequently read the cookies stored by Deutsche Post AG and sync them with other providers\u2019 cookies (cookie syncing a.k.a. cookie matching). To this end, a third-party provider\u2019s cookie ID stored on your device is forwarded to Deutsche Post AG, assigned to the cookie ID issued by the latter and used to implement the purposes mentioned. As the website operator, we document the consent given on our website and provide it to Deutsche Post AG if required.\r\n\r\nThe cookies are used to help record you as a visitor to a website participating in the measurement. This information is then aggregated on the basis of the abovementioned anonymous microcell of Deutsche Post Direkt GmbH and can therefore no longer be assigned to your person.\r\n\r\nThe consent required includes the purposes listed below:\r\n\r\nMeasurement of access to websites I have visited that are participating in Deutsche Post AG\u2019s Consentric procedure, for anonymous inclusion in statistics;\r\nMeasurement of access to websites I have visited that are participating in Deutsche Post AG\u2019s Consentric procedure, in order to identify relevant anonymous microcells of Deutsche Post Direkt GmbH;\r\nTransfer of cookie IDs to partner companies for the purpose of target group formation for the transmission of online advertising. The cookie IDs used for this purpose were selected in advance as a relevant target group based on the indirectly assigned microcell;\r\nMatch against cookies from other providers (cookie matching). A third-party provider\u2019s cookie ID stored on my device may be forwarded to Deutsche Post AG, stored there as a unique cookie ID and used to implement the purposes mentioned above.\r\nYou can object to data processing as part of the procedure described or revoke the consent given at the following link:\r\nhttps://pixel.consentric.de/optout\r\nhttps://login.intelliad.com/optout.php\r\n\r\nPlease note: we can only recognize you and assign your opt-out based on the cookie you have set. For that reason, the cookie remains set even after an opt-out.\r\n\r\nIf you have any further queries regarding the handling of personal data, and in particular if you wish to obtain information about processed personal data or assert additional rights, please contact the website operator first. Further information on data protection in the Consentric procedure mentioned here can be found at https://www.deutschepost.de/de/c/consentric/datenschutz.html.\r\n\r\nThe right to assert your rights as a data subject, also vis-\u00e0-vis Deutsche Post AG, remains unaffected. If you have any queries, please contact: consentric@deutschepost.de.\r\n\r\nThe procedure for labeling a device and assigning an ID to the relevant microcell of Deutsche Post Direkt GmbH was developed in accordance with statutory data protection requirements and was awarded the ADCERT Privacy Audit GmbH (www.adcert.eu) data protection seal of approval by virtue of its outstanding data protection compliance.\r\n\r\nAnalysis by WiredMinds\r\n\r\nOur website uses counting pixel technology provided by WiredMinds GmbH (www.wiredminds.de) to analyze visitor behavior. In connection with this, the IP address of the visitor is processed. The processing occurs only for the purpose of collecting company based information such as company name, for example. IP addresses of natural persons are excluded from any further processing by means of a whitelist.  An IP address is not stored in LeadLab under any circumstances.\r\n\r\nWhile processing data, it is our outmost interest to protect the rights of natural persons. Our interest in processing data is based on Article 6(1)(f) GDPR. At no time is it possible to draw conclusions from the collected data on an identifiable person.\r\n\r\nWiredMinds GmbH uses this information to create anonymized usage profiles of the visit behavior on our website.
