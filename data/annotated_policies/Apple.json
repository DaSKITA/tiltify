{"document": {"document_name": "Apple", "text": "Apple Privacy Policy\r\nUpdated June 1, 2021\r\nApple\u2019s Privacy Policy describes how Apple collects, uses, and shares your personal data.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this Privacy Policy, we provide data and privacy information embedded in our products and certain features that ask to use your personal information. This product-specific information is accompanied by our Data & Privacy Icon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou will be given an opportunity to review this product-specific information before using these features.  You also can view this information at any time, either in Settings related to those features and/or online at apple.com/legal/privacy.\r\n\r\nPlease take a moment to familiarize yourself with our privacy practices, accessible via the headings below, and contact us if you have any questions.\r\n\r\nDownload a copy of this Privacy Policy\r\n \r\nYour California Privacy Disclosures \r\nApple Health Study Apps Privacy Policy\r\nWhat Is Personal Data at Apple?\r\n\r\nAt Apple, we believe strongly in fundamental privacy rights \u2014 and that those fundamental rights should not differ depending on where you live in the world. That\u2019s why we treat any data that relates to an identified or identifiable individual or that is linked or linkable to them by Apple as \u201cpersonal data,\u201d no matter where the individual lives. This means that data that directly identifies you \u2014 such as your name \u2014 is personal data, and also data that does not directly identify you, but that can reasonably be used to identify you \u2014 such as the serial number of your device \u2014 is personal data. Aggregated data is considered non\u2011personal data for the purposes of this Privacy Policy.\r\n\r\nThis Privacy Policy covers how Apple or an Apple-affiliated company handles personal data whether you interact with us on our websites, through Apple apps (such as Apple Music or Wallet), or in person (including by phone or when visiting our retail stores). Apple may also link to third parties on our services or make third-party apps available for download in our App Store. Apple\u2019s Privacy Policy does not apply to how third parties define personal data or how they use it. We encourage you to read their privacy policies and know your privacy rights before interacting with them. \r\n\r\nYour Privacy Rights at Apple\r\n\r\nAt Apple, we respect your ability to know, access, correct, transfer, restrict the processing of, and delete your personal data. We have provided these rights to our global customer base and if you choose to exercise these privacy rights, you have the right not to be treated in a discriminatory way nor to receive a lesser degree of service from Apple. Apple does not sell your data including as \u201csale\u201d is defined in Nevada and California. \r\n\r\nTo exercise your privacy rights and choices, visit the Apple Data and Privacy page at privacy.apple.com for Apple or shazam.com/privacy for Shazam. To help protect the security of your personal data, you must sign in to your account and your identity will be verified. If the Data and Privacy page is not available in your region, you can make privacy rights requests at apple.com/legal/privacy/contact. \r\n\r\nThere may be situations where we cannot grant your request \u2014 for example, if you ask us to delete your transaction data and Apple is legally obligated to keep a record of that transaction to comply with law. We may also decline to grant a request where doing so would undermine our legitimate use of data for anti-fraud and security purposes, such as when you request deletion of an account that is being investigated for security concerns. Other reasons your privacy request may be denied are if it jeopardizes the privacy of others, is frivolous or vexatious, or would be extremely impractical.\r\n\r\nIf you live in California, if you cannot access Apple\u2019s Data and Privacy page, you or your authorized agent can make a request at apple.com/legal/privacy/contact or by calling 1-800-275-2273.\r\n\r\nFor more information on exercising your rights, visit support.apple.com/kb/HT208501. \r\n\r\nPersonal Data Apple Collects from You\r\n\r\nAt Apple, we believe that you can have great products and great privacy. This means that we strive to collect only the personal data that we need. The personal data Apple collects depends on how you interact with Apple. Descriptions of how Apple handles personal data for certain individual services are available at apple.com/legal/privacy/data.\r\n\r\nWhen you create an Apple ID, apply for commercial credit, purchase and/or activate a product or device, download a software update, register for a class at an Apple Store, connect to our services, contact us (including by social media), participate in an online survey, or otherwise interact with Apple, we may collect a variety of information, including:\r\n\r\nAccount Information.

Details such as the content of your communications with Apple, including interactions with customer support and contacts through social media channels\r\n \r\nYou are not required to provide the personal data that we have requested. However, if you choose not to do so, in many cases we will not be able to provide you with our products or services or respond to requests you may have.\r\n\r\nPersonal Data Apple Receives from Other Sources\r\n\r\nApple may receive personal data about you from other individuals, from businesses or third parties acting at your direction, from our partners who work with us to provide our products and services and assist us in security and fraud prevention, and from other lawful sources.\r\n\r\nIndividuals.

You may direct other individuals or third parties to share data with Apple. For example, you may direct your mobile carrier to share data about your carrier account with Apple for account activation, or for your loyalty program to share information about your participation so that you can earn rewards for Apple purchases. \r\nApple Partners. We may also validate the information you provide \u2014 for example, when creating an Apple ID, with a third party for security, and for fraud-prevention purposes.\r\n \r\nFor research and development purposes, we may use datasets such as those that contain images, voices, or other data that could be associated with an identifiable person. When acquiring such datasets, we do so in accordance with applicable law, including law in the jurisdiction in which the dataset is hosted. When using such datasets for research and development, we do not attempt to reidentify individuals who may appear therein.\r\n\r\nApple\u2019s Use of Personal Data\r\n\r\nApple uses personal data to power our services, to process your transactions, to communicate with you, for security and fraud prevention, and to comply with law. We may also use personal data for other purposes with your consent. \r\n\r\nApple uses your personal data only when we have a valid legal basis to do so. Depending on the circumstance, Apple may rely on your consent or the fact that the processing is necessary to fulfill a contract with you, protect your vital interests or those of other persons, or to comply with law. We may also process your personal data where we believe it is in our or others\u2019 legitimate interests, taking into consideration your interests, rights, and expectations. If you have questions about the legal basis, you can contact the Data Protection Officer at apple.com/legal/privacy/contact.\r\n\r\nPower Our Services. Apple collects personal data necessary to power our services, which may include personal data collected to personalize or improve our offerings, for internal purposes such as auditing or data analysis, or for troubleshooting. For example, if you would like to access a song through an Apple Music subscription, we collect data on what songs you play in order to provide you with the content requested and for royalty purposes.\r\nProcess Your Transactions. To process transactions, Apple must collect data such as your name, purchase, and payment information.\r\nCommunicate with You. To respond to communications, reach out to you about your transactions or account, market our products and services, provide other relevant information, or request information or feedback. From time to time, we may use your personal data to send important notices, such as communications about purchases and changes to our terms, conditions, and policies. Because this information is important to your interaction with Apple, you may not opt out of receiving these important notices. \r\nSecurity and Fraud Prevention. To protect individuals, employees, and Apple and for loss prevention and to prevent fraud, including to protect individuals, employees, and Apple for the benefit of all our users, and prescreening or scanning uploaded content for potentially illegal content, including child sexual exploitation material.\r\nComply with Law.

Further, Apple does not share personal data with third parties for their own marketing purposes. \r\n\r\nService Providers. Apple may engage third parties to act as our service providers and perform certain tasks on our behalf, such as processing or storing data, including personal data, in connection with your use of our services and delivering products to customers. Apple service providers are obligated to handle personal data consistent with this Privacy Policy and according to our instructions. They cannot use the personal data we share for their own purposes and must delete or return the personal data once they've fulfilled our request.\r\nPartners. At times, Apple may partner with third parties to provide services or other offerings. For example, Apple financial offerings like Apple Card and Apple Cash are offered by Apple and our partners. Apple requires its partners to protect your personal data.\r\nOthers. Apple may share personal data with others at your direction or with your consent, such as when we share information with your carrier to activate your account. We may also disclose information about you if we determine that for purposes of national security, law enforcement, or other issues of public importance, disclosure is necessary or appropriate. We may also disclose information about you where there is a lawful basis for doing so, if we determine that disclosure is reasonably necessary to enforce our terms and conditions or to protect our operations or users, or in the event of a reorganization, merger, or sale. \r\n \r\nIf you purchase a third-party subscription from the App Store or within Apple News, we create a Subscriber ID that is unique to you and the developer or publisher. The Subscriber ID may be used to provide reports to the developer or publisher, which include information about the subscription you purchased and your country of residence. If you cancel all of your subscriptions with a particular developer or publisher, the Subscriber ID will reset after 180 days if you do not resubscribe. This information is provided to developers or publishers so that they can understand the performance of their subscriptions.\r\n\r\nProtection of Personal Data at Apple\r\n\r\nAt Apple, we believe that great privacy rests on great security. We use administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect your personal data, taking into account the nature of the personal data and the processing, and the threats posed. We are constantly working to improve on these safeguards to help keep your personal data secure. For more information, visit our Apple Platform Security guide. \r\n\r\nChildren and Personal Data\r\n\r\nApple understands the importance of safeguarding the personal data of children, which we consider to be an individuals under the age of 13 or the equivalent age as specified by law in your jurisdiction. That is why Apple has implemented additional processes and protections to help keep children's personal data safe.\r\n\r\nTo access certain Apple services, a child must have a child Apple ID. A child Apple ID may be created by the parent or, in the case of a Managed Apple ID, by the child's educational institution.\r\n\r\nParents. To create a child account, parents must review the Family Privacy Disclosure for Children, which describes how Apple handles children's personal data. If they agree, the parent must provide Apple with a verifiable parental consent. \r\nEducational Institutions. Educational institutions that participate in the Apple School Manager Program may also create Apple IDs for students, called \"Managed Apple IDs.\u201d These schools are required to agree to the Managed Apple IDs for Students Disclosure which is included as Exhibit A to the Apple School Manager Agreement.\r\n \r\nIf we learn that a child's personal data was collected without appropriate authorization, it will be deleted as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nTo exercise privacy rights for your child's information, visit the Apple Data and Privacy page at privacy.apple.com and sign in to their account.\r\n\r\nCookies and Other Technologies\r\n\r\nApple\u2019s websites, online services, interactive applications, and advertisements may use \u201ccookies\u201d and other technologies such as web beacons. These technologies help us to better understand user behavior including for security and fraud prevention purposes, tell us which parts of our websites people have visited, and facilitate and measure the effectiveness of advertisements and web searches.\r\n\r\nCommunications Cookies. These cookies are used to enable network traffic to and from Apple\u2019s systems, including by helping us detect any errors.\r\nStrictly Necessary Cookies. These cookies are set as required to provide a specific feature or service that you have accessed or requested. For example, they allow us to display our websites in the proper format and language, to authenticate and verify your transactions, and to preserve the contents of your Bag when shopping online at apple.com. \r\nOther Cookies. These cookies are used to understand how visitors interact with our websites and online services, including by helping us to assess the effectiveness of advertisements and web searches. Apple also uses these cookies to remember choices you make while browsing, so we can provide you with a customized experience. \r\n \r\nIf you prefer that Apple not use cookies, we provide you with the means to disable their use. If you want to disable cookies and you\u2019re using the Safari web browser, choose \u201cBlock all cookies\u201d in Safari\u2019s privacy settings. If you are using a different browser, check with your provider to find out how to disable cookies. Certain features of the Apple website may not be available if all cookies are disabled.\r\n\r\nIn addition to cookies, Apple uses other technologies that help us achieve similar objectives. \r\n\r\nIn some email messages Apple sends to you, we provide a \u201cclick-through URL\u201d that links you to content on the Apple website. When you click one of these URLs, they pass through a separate server before arriving at the destination page on our website. We track this click-through to help us determine interest in particular topics and measure whether we are communicating with you effectively. If you prefer not to be tracked in this way, you should not click graphic or text links in email messages.\r\n\r\nApple generally treats data we collect using these cookies and similar technologies as nonpersonal data. However, to the extent that Internet Protocol (IP) addresses or similar identifiers are considered personal data by local law, we also treat these identifiers as personal data in those regions. In addition, Apple sometimes combines nonpersonal data collected from these technologies with other personal data Apple holds. When we combine data in this way, we treat the combined data as personal data for purposes of this Privacy Policy.\r\n\r\nAds that are delivered by Apple\u2019s advertising platform may appear in Apple News, Stocks, or in the App Store. If you do not want to receive ads targeted to your interests from Apple's advertising platform in those apps, you can choose to disable Personalized Ads, which will opt your Apple ID out of receiving such ads regardless of what device you are using. On your iOS or iPadOS device, you can disable Personalized Ads by going to Settings > Privacy > Apple Advertising and tapping to turn off Personalized Ads. On your Mac, you can disable Personalized Ads by choosing Apple menu > System Preferences > Security & Privacy, clicking Privacy, clicking Advertising, and deselecting Personalized Ads. You may still see ads in the App Store, Apple News, or Stocks based on context like your search query or the channel you are reading. If you disable Allow Apps to Request to Track, third-party apps cannot request to use the Advertising Identifier, a non personal identifier served by the operating system on your device, to track you across apps and websites owned by other companies.\r\n\r\nTransfer of Personal Data Between Countries\r\n\r\nApple products and offerings connect you to the world. To make that possible, your personal data may be transferred to or accessed by entities around the world. Apple complies with laws on the transfer of personal data between countries to help ensure your data is protected, wherever it may be.\r\n\r\nThe Apple entity that controls your personal data may differ depending on where you live. For example, retail store information is controlled by individual retail entities in each country and Apple Media Services-related personal data may be controlled by various Apple entities as reflected in the terms of service. If you do not reside in the U.S., your personal data may be processed by Apple Inc. on behalf of the Apple entity controlling personal data for your jurisdiction.

In the event that a privacy issue has resulted in a negative impact on you or another person, we will take steps to address that with you or that other person.\r\n\r\nIf you are not satisfied with Apple\u2019s response, you may refer your complaint to the applicable regulator.
