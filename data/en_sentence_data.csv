1. Introduction
This Privacy Policy sets out how we, Telegram Messenger Inc. (“Telegram”), use and protect your personal data that you provide to us, or that is otherwise obtained or generated by us, in connection with your use of our cloud-based messaging services (the “Services”).",None
1326,"For the purposes of this Privacy Policy, ‘we’, ‘us’ and ‘our’ refers to Telegram, and ‘you’ refers to you, the user of the Services.",None
1327,"

1.1 Privacy Principles
Telegram has two fundamental principles when it comes to collecting and processing private data:

We don't use your data to show you ads.",None
1328,"
We only store the data that Telegram needs to function as a secure and feature-rich messaging service.",None
1329,"1.2. Terms of Service
This Privacy Policy forms part of our Terms of Service, which describes the terms under which you use our Services and which are available at https://telegram.org/tos.",None
1330,This Privacy Policy should therefore be read in conjunction with those terms.,None
1331,"

1.3. Table of Contents
This Privacy Policy explains the following:

the legal basis for processing your personal data;",None
1332,"
what personal data we may collect from you;",None
1333,"
what we may use your personal data for;",None
1334,"
who your personal data may be shared with; and
your rights regarding your personal data.",None
1335,"If you live in a country in the European Economic Area (EEA), the Services are provided by Telegram, which for the purposes of applicable data protection legislation is the data controller responsible for your personal data when you use our Services.",None
1336,"However, as Telegram is located outside the EEA, we have designated one of our EEA-based group companies, Telegram UK Holdings Ltd (71-75 Shelton Street, Covent Garden, London, England, WC2H 9JQ), as a representative to whom you may direct any issues you have relating to our processing of your personal data.",None
1337,"

2. Legal Ground for Processing Your Personal Data
We process your personal data on the ground that such processing is necessary to further our legitimate interests (including: (1) providing effective and innovative Services to our users; and (2) to detect, prevent or otherwise address fraud or security issues in respect of our provision of Services), unless those interests are overridden by your interest or fundamental rights and freedoms that require protections of personal data.",None
1338,"

3. What Personal Data We Use
",None
1339,"3.1. Basic Account Data
",None
1340,Telegram is a communication service.,None
1341,"You provide your mobile number and basic account data (which may include profile name, profile picture and about information) to create a Telegram account.",None
1342,"

To make it easier for your contacts and other people to reach you and recognize who you are, the screen name you choose, your profile pictures, and your username (should you choose to set one) on Telegram are always public.",None
1343,"We don't want to know your real name, gender, age or what you like.",None
1344,"

We do not require your screen name to be your real name.",None
1345,Note that users who have you in their contacts will see you by the name they saved and not by your screen name.,None
1346,"This way your mother can have the public name 'Johnny Depp' while appearing as 'Mom' to you and as 'Boss' to her underlings at work (or the other way around, depending on how these relationships are structured).",None
1347,"

3.2. Your E-mail Address
When you enable 2-step-verification for your account or store documents using the Telegram Passport feature, you can opt to set up a password recovery email.",None
1348,This address will only be used to send you a password recovery code if you forget it.,None
1349,That's right: no marketing or “we miss you” bullshit.,None
1350,"Cloud Chats
",None
1351,Telegram is a cloud service.,None
1352,"We store messages, photos, videos and documents from your cloud chats on our servers so that you can access your data from any of your devices anytime without having to rely on third-party backups.",None
1353,All data is stored heavily encrypted and the encryption keys in each case are stored in several other data centers in different jurisdictions.,None
1354,This way local engineers or physical intruders cannot get access to user data.,None
1355,"Chats
Secret chats use end-to-end encryption.",None
1356,This means that all data is encrypted with a key that only you and the recipient know.,None
1357,There is no way for us or anybody else without direct access to your device to learn what content is being sent in those messages.,None
1358,We do not store your secret chats on our servers.,None
1359,"We also do not keep any logs for messages in secret chats, so after a short period of time we no longer know who or when you messaged via secret chats.",None
1360,For the same reasons secret chats are not available in the cloud — you can only access those messages from the device they were sent to or from.,None
1361,"

3.3.3. Media in Secret Chats
When you send photos, videos or files via secret chats, before being uploaded, each item is encrypted with a separate key, not known to the server.",None
1362,"This key and the file’s location are then encrypted again, this time with the secret chat’s key — and sent to your recipient.",None
1363,They can then download and decipher the file.,None
1364,"This means that the file is technically on one of Telegram’s servers, but it looks like a piece of random indecipherable garbage to everyone except for you and the recipient.",None
1365,We don’t know what this random data stands for and we have no idea which particular chat it belongs to.,None
1366,We periodically purge this random data from our servers to save disk space.,None

",None
1368,"In addition to private messages, Telegram also supports public channels and public groups.",None
1369,All public chats are cloud chats (see section 3.3.1 above).,None
1370,"Like everything on Telegram, the data you post in public communities is encrypted, both in storage and in transit — but everything you post in public will be accessible to everyone.",None
1371,"

3.4. Phone Number and Contacts
Telegram uses phone numbers as unique identifiers so that it is easy for you to switch from SMS and other messaging apps and retain your social graph.",None
1372,We ask your permission before syncing your contacts.,None
1373,"

We store your up-to-date contacts in order to notify you as soon as one of your contacts signs up for Telegram and to properly display names in notifications.",None
1374,We only need the number and name (first and last) for this to work and store no other data about your contacts.,None
1375,"

Our automatic algorithms can also use anonymized sets of phone numbers to calculate the average number of potential contacts an unregistered phone",None
1376,number may have on Telegram.,None
1377,"When you open the 'Invite friends' interface, we display the resulting statistics next to your contacts to give you an idea of who could benefit most from joining Telegram.",None
1378,"

You can always stop syncing contacts or delete them from our servers in Settings > Privacy & Security > Data Settings.",None
1379,"

If you are using Android, Telegram will ask you for permission to access your phone call logs (READ_CALL_LOG).",None
1380,"If you grant this permission, Telegram will be able verify your account by transmitting a phone call instead of asking you to enter a code.",None
1381,Telegram uses this permission only to confirm receipt of the confirmation call by verifying the number in the call log.,None
1382,"If you share a location in a chat, this location data is treated like other messages in cloud or secret chats respectively.",None
1383,"

If you share your Live Location in any chat or turn on ’Make Myself Visible’ in People Nearby, Telegram will use your data to display your location to those users with whom you are sharing it, even when the app is closed – for as long as you keep these optional features activated.",None
1384,"3.6. Cookies
The only cookies we use are those to operate and provide our Services on the web.",None
1385,We do not use cookies for profiling or advertising.,None
1386,"The cookies we use are small text files that allow us to provide and customize our Services, and in doing so provide you with an enhanced user experience.",None
1387,"Your browser should allow you to control these cookies, including whether or not to accept them and how to remove them.",None

4. Keeping Your Personal Data Safe

1390,"If you signed up for Telegram from the UK or the EEA, your data is stored in data centers in the Netherlands.",None
1391,These are third-party provided data centers in which Telegram rents a designated space.,None
1392,"However, the servers and networks that sit inside these data centers and on which your personal data is stored are owned by Telegram.",None
1393,"As such, we do not share your personal data with such data centers.",None
1394,All data is stored heavily encrypted so that local Telegram engineers or physical intruders cannot get access.,None
1395,"

4.2. End-to-End Encrypted Data
Your messages, media and files from secret chats (see section 3.3.2 above), as well as the contents of your calls and the data you store in your Telegram Passport are processed only on your device and on the device of your recipient.",None
1396,"Before this data reaches our servers, it is encrypted with a key known only to you and the recipient.",None
1397,"While Telegram servers will handle this end-to-end encrypted data to deliver it to the recipient – or store it in the case of Telegram Passport data, we have no ways of deciphering the actual information.",None
1398,"In this case, we neither store nor process your personal data, rather we store and process random sequences of symbols that have no meaning without the keys which we don’t have.",None
1399,"

4.3. Retention
Unless stated otherwise in this Privacy Policy, the personal data that you provide us will only be stored for as long as it is necessary for us to fulfill our obligations in respect of the provision of the Services.",None

1403,5.2. Safety and Security,None
1404,Telegram supports massive communities which we have to police against abuse and Terms of Service violations.,None
1405,Telegram also has more than 400 million users which makes it a lucrative target for spammers.,None
1406,"To improve the security of your account, as well as to prevent spam, abuse, and other violations of our Terms of Service, we may collect metadata such as your IP address, devices and Telegram apps you've used, history of username changes, etc.",None

1416,"

5.5. Advanced features

1417,We may use some aggregated data about how you use Telegram to build useful features.,None
1418,"For example, when you open the Search menu, Telegram displays the people you are more likely to message in a box at the top of the screen.",None
1419,"To do this, we calculate a rating that shows which people you message frequently.",None
1420,A similar rating is calculated for inline bots so that the app can suggest the bots you are most likely to use in the attachment menu (or when you start a new message with “@”).,None
1421,"To turn this feature off and delete the relevant data, go to Settings > Privacy & Security > Data Settings and disable “",None

1424,cloud service.,None
1425,Telegram has an API that allows third-party developers to create bots.,None
1426,"Bots are apps that look like special Telegram users: you can talk to them from your chat list, add them to groups or use a special “inline” interface to access their features.",None
1427,"By performing any of these actions, you will be sending some of your data to the respective third-party bot developers.",None
1428,"

6.2. How Bots Can Receive Data

By sending messages to a bot.",None

Bots can also receive the following data when you interact with them.",None
1436,"

Bots will obviously get your messages when you send them something.",None
1437,"If you click on links or buttons provided by the bot, the bot can potentially get your IP address (provided that it controls the website to which the link leads).",None
1438,"If the bot is a member of the same group with you, it may know you are a member.",None
1439,"
When you start your message with the username of an inline bot (e.g. @gif)",None
1440,the interface transforms so that everything you type becomes a query to that bot.,None
1441,This query is sent to the bot so that it can provide its service.,None
1442,We will warn you about this the first time you use an inline bot.,None
1443,"
Bots added to groups can operate in two modes: with access to messages in the group or without access.",None
1444,"If the bot has access to messages, it can see everything that happens in the group.",None
1445,The interface clearly shows whether or not a bot has access to messages in groups.,None

1457,Your credit card information never reaches Telegram's servers.,None
1458,We do not access and do not store your credit card information.,None

1466,"Disputes
Due to the fact that Telegram doesn't store any",None

How we use personal data
Microsoft uses the data we collect to provide you rich, interactive experiences.",None

Provide our products, which includes updating, securing, and troubleshooting, as well as providing support.",None
1669,"It also includes sharing data, when it is required to provide the service or carry out the transactions you request.",None

Improve and develop our products.",None

Personalize our products and make recommendations.",None
1672,"
Advertise and market to you, which includes sending promotional communications, targeting advertising, and presenting you relevant offers.",None
1673,"
We also use the data to operate our business, which includes analyzing our performance, meeting our legal obligations, developing our workforce, and doing research.",None
1674,"

For these purposes, we combine data we collect from different contexts (for example, from your use of two Microsoft products).",None
1675,"For example Cortana may use information from your calendar to suggest action items in a heads-up email, and Microsoft Store uses information about the",None
1676,apps and services you use to make personalized app recommendations.,None

1679,unauthenticated (not signed in),None

Our processing of personal data for these purposes includes both automated and manual (human) methods of processing.",None
1682,Our automated methods often are related to and supported by our manual methods.,None

1685,"For example, we manually review",None
1686,short snippets of voice data that we have taken steps to de-identify to improve our speech recognition technologies.,None
1687,This manual review may be conducted by Microsoft employees or vendors who are working on Microsoft’s behalf.,None
1688,"

When we process personal data about you, we do so with your consent and/or as required to provide the products you use, operate our business, meet our contractual and legal obligations, protect the security of our systems and our customers, or fulfill other legitimate interests of Microsoft as described in this section and in the Reasons we share personal data section of this privacy statement.",None

How we use personal data
Microsoft uses the data we collect to provide you rich, interactive experiences.",None
3432,"In particular, we use data to:

Provide our products, which includes updating, securing, and troubleshooting, as well as providing support.",None

3437,"
We also use the data to operate our business, which includes analyzing our performance, meeting our legal obligations, developing our workforce, and doing research.",None
3438,"

For these purposes, we combine data we collect from different contexts (for example, from your use of two Microsoft products).",None
3439,"For example Cortana may use information from your calendar to suggest action items in a heads-up email, and Microsoft Store uses information about the",None
3440,apps and services you use to make personalized app recommendations.,None

3443,unauthenticated (not signed in),None
3444,"separately from any account information that directly identifies you, such as your name, email address, or phone number.",None

3446,Our automated methods often are related to and supported by our manual methods.,None

3449,"For example, we manually review",None
3450,short snippets of voice data that we have taken steps to de-identify to improve our speech recognition technologies.,None
